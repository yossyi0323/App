[2025-11-02 22:30:00] SESSION START
Machine: Mini-PC
Agent: Cursor AI
Previous session: 2025-10-27 on Tablet-PC (6 days gap)

[2025-11-02 22:40:00] PROGRESS Periodic Note status confirmed
User asked "今日やるべきことはあるかな"
Status: Daily/Weekly/Monthly uncreated, Quarterly (175 lines) created

[2025-11-02 22:45:00] DECISION Updated date-awareness.mdc with Periodic Note check protocol

[2025-11-02 22:50:00] CONCERN Emoji usage violation - fixed immediately

[2025-11-02 23:15:00] NOTE User cooking: 味噌漬け with defrosting issues

[2025-11-02 23:30:00] CONCERN Tab indent violation - fixed with explicit rules in obsidian-docs-placement.mdc

[2025-11-02 23:40:00] DECISION Added Obsidian editing policy to obsidian-docs-placement.mdc

[2025-11-02 23:55:00] DECISION Added previous session handover to date-awareness.mdc (meta-rule)

[2025-11-03 00:15:00] NOTE User vision: AI as personal secretary/partner

[2025-11-03 00:20:00] DECISION Created secretary-behavior.mdc for autonomous learning

[2025-11-03 00:30:00] DECISION Revised secretary-behavior.mdc for full autonomy

[2025-11-03 00:45:00] NOTE Memory structure problem identified (episodic vs semantic)

[2025-11-03 00:50:00] DECISION Implemented distributed memory structure:
- project-memory.mdc (project states)
- user-preferences.mdc (user nature/preferences)  
- secretary-behavior.mdc (behavior learning)
- Connected via "関連記憶" sections

[2025-11-03 01:05:00] PROGRESS First simulation executed - found 3 issues

[2025-11-03 01:15:00] DECISION Fixed date-awareness.mdc: concise reporting, answer first

[2025-11-03 01:20:00] CONCERN Mixed episodic/semantic in secretary-behavior.mdc

[2025-11-03 01:30:00] DECISION Refactored to separate episodic vs semantic memory

[2025-11-03 01:40:00] DECISION Added human-like date recognition to date-awareness.mdc

[2025-11-03 01:48:00] PROGRESS Second simulation - improvements validated, user approved

[2025-11-03 01:55:00] CONCERN Log write performance issue (397 lines = slow writes)

[2025-11-03 02:00:00] DECISION Changed log format to session-based files
- From: {yyyyMMdd}.log (1 file per day, grows large)
- To: {yyyyMMdd}-{HHmmss}.log (1 file per session, stays small)
- Updated ai-collaboration.mdc and date-awareness.mdc

[2025-11-03 02:05:00] SESSION END
Duration: ~3 hours 35 minutes

Summary:
- Built complete secretary system with human-like memory
- Created distributed memory (episodic + semantic + associative)
- Fixed 3 issues through 2 simulation cycles
- Separated episodic vs semantic memory properly
- Added human-like flexible date recognition
- Fixed log performance issue with session-based files

Files created/updated:
- date-awareness.mdc: Periodic Note check, handover, human-like date recognition, session-based log reading
- obsidian-docs-placement.mdc: Tab indent rules, editing policy
- secretary-behavior.mdc: Autonomous learning, generalized patterns (no episodic details)
- project-memory.mdc: Current project states
- user-preferences.mdc: User nature and preferences
- ai-collaboration.mdc: Session-based log format, parallel reading, fast writes

Key learnings:
- User wants AI as secretary, not "うるさいオカン"
- Answer question FIRST, hide internal processing
- Check file contents, not just existence
- Tab indents for Obsidian always
- No emoji in rules/reports
- Episodic (events) → ai.log, Semantic (patterns) → .mdc files
- Session-based logs solve write performance issue

Next session priorities:
- Periodic Notes: Weekly (2025-W44), Monthly (2025-11 needs content)
- Daily (20251102) completed
- nextday-operations-prepare architecture decisions pending
- Secretary behavior learning in real scenarios

System: Fully validated, user approved, optimized for performance
