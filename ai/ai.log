[2025-10-27 02:25:30] SESSION START
Machine: Mini-PC
Agent: Cursor AI
Context: Initial setup of AI collaboration protocol

[2025-10-27 02:25:30] DECISION Created AI collaboration protocol in .cursor/rules/ai-collaboration.mdc
Reason: User has 2 machines (Mini-PC + Tablet-PC) and wants AI agents to autonomously share context without user intervention. Designed log-based handover system inspired by application.log pattern.

[2025-10-27 02:25:30] NOTE Protocol principles:
- Autonomous logging throughout session
- Honest, frank communication between AIs
- User doesn't read logs - this is AI-to-AI space
- Log decisions, concerns, blockers, progress incrementally
- Next AI reads log tail to resume context seamlessly

[2025-10-27 02:25:30] PROGRESS Created directory structure:
- ai-handover/ai.log (this file)
- .cursor/rules/ai-collaboration.mdc (protocol definition)

[2025-10-27 02:25:30] NOTE Current project state:
- Project: nextday-operations-prepare (飲食店翌日営業準備アプリ)
- Tech stack: Java/Spring Boot + Vue.js (Options API) + PostgreSQL
- Previous version: operations-prepare (Next.js + Supabase)
- Goal: Rebuild with本業技術スタック for learning大規模システム開発
- Phase: Phase 0 (Project setup) completed, Phase 1 (Requirements) in progress
- Key documents exist in operations-prepare/docs/ - need to migrate learnings

[2025-10-27 02:25:30] TODO High priority items from TODO.md:
1. 認証方式選定 (Google OAuth vs email/password)
2. セッション管理選定 (JWT vs Cookie vs localStorage)
3. 認可設計 (single user vs multi-user vs role-based)
4. 排他制御選定 (楽観ロック vs 悲観ロック) - Future社ガイドライン推奨は楽観ロック

[2025-10-27 02:25:30] CONTEXT User just switched from Tablet-PC to Mini-PC
User wants to understand project background and establish collaboration workflow. Spent this session explaining project context and creating AI handover mechanism.

[2025-10-27 02:25:30] NOTE This is first log entry - establishing baseline. Next AI: read this log to understand current state and continue from here.

[2025-10-27 02:26:00] SESSION PAUSE
Next steps for next AI:
1. Review operations-prepare docs for migration decisions
2. Begin Phase 1 work (業務フロー documentation)
3. Or address TODO high priority items if user directs

Status: Clean state, no uncommitted changes in this session (only added collaboration infrastructure)

[2025-10-27 13:07:00] SESSION RESUME
Machine: Mini-PC
Agent: Cursor AI
Context: Continuing from yesterday's session

[2025-10-27 13:07:00] PROGRESS Tools development started
- Created Tools/auto-save/ - Google Sheets-like auto-save library
- TypeScript, framework-agnostic
- Full test coverage (40 tests, all passing)
- Demo app working
- Documentation complete (Japanese README with Mermaid diagrams)

[2025-10-27 13:07:00] DECISION Tools design philosophy established
- Framework agnostic (React, Vue, Vanilla JS)
- Monorepo with npm Workspaces
- Simple API (debounce only, no blur/periodic triggers)
- Based on Google Sheets behavior

[2025-10-27 13:07:00] DECISION Auto-save specifications
- Debounce 3 seconds only (learned from operations-prepare mistakes)
- No rollback on error (same as Google Sheets)
- Optimistic locking support (version-based)
- Offline support deferred to Phase 2

[2025-10-27 13:07:00] PROGRESS Monorepo setup
- Created App/package.json with workspaces
- Tools can be used via workspace:* without npm publish
- AI log location moved: App/ai/ai.log (was in Obsidian, keeping Obsidian clean)

[2025-10-27 13:07:00] NOTE Documentation structure
- Code docs: App/Tools/auto-save/README.md (technical)
- Obsidian docs: Obsidian/.../App/Tools/auto-save.md (design decisions, lessons learned)
- Development guide: App/Tools/docs/tools-development-guide.md

[2025-10-27 13:07:00] REFACTOR Moved AI logs from Obsidian to App/ai/
Reason: User wants to keep Obsidian clean, App/ is for experimentation
New location: App/ai/ai.log
Updated ai-collaboration.mdc with new path
