[2025-10-27 14:19:00] SESSION START
Machine: Unknown (workspace setup phase)
Agent: Cursor AI
Previous session: N/A (first session with new log structure)
Resuming from: Rule files review and ai-collaboration protocol update

[2025-10-27 14:20:15] DECISION Changed AI collaboration log structure from single ai.log to daily files (yyyyMMdd.log). Reason: User requested to avoid long files that are difficult to read. Daily separation provides better organization and easier reference to specific dates.

[2025-10-27 14:21:30] PROGRESS Read and understood 8 rule files:
- ai-collaboration.mdc: AI-to-AI handover protocol
- concrete-language.mdc: No vague expressions, always use specific numbers/facts
- date-awareness.mdc: Always confirm current date, Obsidian daily note format is yyyyMMdd.md
- documentation-writing.mdc: Separate concerns, avoid over-generalization
- judgment-criteria.mdc: Never use "Pros/Cons", always define evaluation criteria
- no-emoji-usage.mdc: No emoji usage without explicit user request
- obsidian-docs-placement.mdc: Document placement rules for Obsidian
- rule-management.mdc: Rule file naming and management

[2025-10-27 14:22:00] PROGRESS Updated ai-collaboration.mdc:
- Changed log location from single ai.log to daily {yyyyMMdd}.log files
- Updated session start protocol to read today's log + previous days if needed
- Updated file operations example code to use daily log files
- Added "Daily Separation" to core principles

[2025-10-27 14:23:00] NOTE Current project context:
- Working on nextday-operations-prepare (営業準備アプリ)
- Frontend: Vue.js + shadcn-vue (selected based on operations-prepare design)
- Backend: Spring Boot + Springdoc OpenAPI
- Database: PostgreSQL + A5:SQL Mk-2 for ER diagrams
- Documentation: Centralized in Obsidian Vault
- Key decisions recorded in ADRs (001: API spec format, 002: Frontend UI framework)

[2025-10-27 14:23:30] NOTE Pending architectural decisions identified in previous session:
- Authentication method (Google OAuth, email, ID/password)
- Session management (JWT, Cookie, localStorage, server session)
- Authorization (RBAC, ABAC, simple role-based)
- Optimistic locking vs pessimistic locking
- Multiple other decisions tracked in アーキテクチャ検討項目一覧.md

[2025-10-27 14:24:00] NOTE User preferences and rules understood:
- Always use concrete language with specific numbers/facts
- Never use "Good/Bad" or "Pros/Cons" - define evaluation criteria instead
- No emoji usage
- Confirm current date for time-sensitive queries
- Obsidian daily notes use yyyyMMdd.md format (no hyphens)
- User prefers minimal interaction - proceed with inferred actions unless clarification needed
- Always verify code works before reporting completion

[2025-10-27 14:25:00] CONCERN User noticed large number of .class files in Git diff. These are Maven build artifacts that should not be tracked.

[2025-10-27 14:26:00] DECISION Added Maven-related patterns to .gitignore:
- C:\Users\YOSHITO\Documents\App\.gitignore (root level)
- C:\Users\YOSHITO\Documents\App\UniwaApp\nextday-operations-prepare\.gitignore (project level)
Patterns added: target/, *.class, *.jar, *.war, and other Maven artifacts.

[2025-10-27 14:27:00] PROGRESS Removed target/ directories from Git tracking:
- UniwaApp/nextday-operations-prepare/moc-app/backend/target/
- typescript-generator-sample/target/
Total 39 files removed from Git index using `git rm --cached -r`

[2025-10-27 14:28:00] PROGRESS User completed cleanup manually. Final status:
- Only rust-app-example/ remains as untracked
- All .class and target/ files successfully excluded from Git
- .gitignore files staged and ready for commit

[2025-10-27 14:30:00] SESSION END
Duration: ~11 minutes
Files modified: 
- C:\Users\YOSHITO\Documents\App\.cursor\rules\ai-collaboration.mdc
- C:\Users\YOSHITO\Documents\App\.gitignore
- C:\Users\YOSHITO\Documents\App\UniwaApp\nextday-operations-prepare\.gitignore
- C:\Users\YOSHITO\Documents\App\ai\20251027.log (this log)

Summary:
- Reviewed all rule files and confirmed understanding
- Updated AI collaboration protocol to use daily log files instead of single file
- Fixed Git issue: removed Maven build artifacts (target/, *.class) from tracking
- Added comprehensive .gitignore rules for Maven projects
- Ready to proceed with nextday-operations-prepare development

Top priorities for next session:
1. Authentication method selection (highest priority architectural decision)
2. Session management selection
3. Database optimistic locking implementation
4. Continue with development phases as outlined in project docs

Context notes:
- User has existing operations-prepare app (Next.js) as design reference
- Playwright scripts exist for capturing app screenshots
- shadcn-vue selected as frontend UI framework to match operations-prepare design
- All architectural decisions should be recorded as ADRs
- Technical evaluations should use comparison tables with specific evaluation criteria
- Git is now properly configured to ignore build artifacts
