[2025-11-02 22:30:00] SESSION START
Machine: Mini-PC
Agent: Cursor AI
Previous session: 2025-10-27 on Tablet-PC
Resuming from: 6 days gap since last session

[2025-11-02 22:35:00] NOTE Current date awareness issue
User pointed out I incorrectly said "Saturday" when it was actually Sunday (2025-11-02 Sunday).
Reminded to always confirm date with correct day-of-week format.

[2025-11-02 22:40:00] PROGRESS Confirmed Periodic Note status
User asked "今日やるべきことはあるかな" - this triggers Periodic Note check per date-awareness.mdc.

Status:
- Daily Note (20251102.md): Not created
- Weekly Note (2025-W44.md): Not created
- Monthly Note (2025-11.md): Not created
- Quarterly Note (2025-Q4.md): Created, 175 lines, detailed Q4 goals

[2025-11-02 22:45:00] DECISION Updated date-awareness.mdc with Periodic Note check protocol
Reason: User requested that "やること" questions should always trigger Periodic Note status check.
Added comprehensive section explaining:
- Which notes to check (Daily/Weekly/Monthly/Quarterly)
- File name formats and paths
- Reporting format template
- Importance of reporting uncreated notes

[2025-11-02 22:50:00] CONCERN Emoji usage violation
Used emoji (❌✅) in reporting format template despite no-emoji-usage.mdc rule.
Fixed immediately after user pointed it out.

[2025-11-02 23:15:00] NOTE User's daily activity: Cooking experiment
User made 味噌漬け (miso-marinated meat).
Issues encountered:
- Insufficient defrosting (microwave left core frozen)
- Surface burned but inside undercooked (red parts remained)
- Had to re-cook, which caused miso aroma to dissipate

Root cause analysis:
Insufficient defrosting → uneven cooking → overcooking to compensate → lost flavor

User wants to record this in Daily Note (20251102.md).

[2025-11-02 23:30:00] CONCERN Tab indent rule violation
Provided Daily Note content suggestion using space indents instead of tabs.
User pointed out: obsidian-docs-placement.mdc requires tab indents for Obsidian documents.

Critical mistake: Said "気をつけます" without fixing the rule - meaningless for future AI agents.

[2025-11-02 23:40:00] DECISION Updated obsidian-docs-placement.mdc with explicit tab indent rules
Reason: User correctly identified that verbal acknowledgment is useless; must write rules for future AIs.

Added comprehensive "Obsidianドキュメント編集ルール" section:
- Basic policy: Obsidian is user's personal notes, AI provides suggestions only
- Tab indent mandatory for all Obsidian markdown
- Examples of correct (tab) vs incorrect (space) indents
- Clear scope: all Periodic Notes and Obsidian Vault files

[2025-11-02 23:44:00] SESSION PAUSE
Duration: ~1 hour 15 minutes

Summary of work:
- Updated date-awareness.mdc: Added Periodic Note status check protocol for "やること" queries
- Updated obsidian-docs-placement.mdc: Added explicit tab indent rules with examples
- Fixed emoji usage violation in rule files
- Assisted with user's cooking reflection (Daily Note content)

Key learnings for next AI:
- Always check Periodic Note status when user asks about "やること"
- ALWAYS use tab indents when suggesting Obsidian document content
- No emoji in rule files or reports
- Verbal promises like "気をつけます" are meaningless - write rules instead

Next session priorities:
- User still needs to create 3 Periodic Notes: Daily (20251102), Weekly (2025-W44), Monthly (2025-11)
- Q4 Quarterly note is well-written and can serve as reference
- nextday-operations-prepare architecture decisions remain pending (authentication, session management, authorization, locking)

Context notes:
- User syncs via Git between Mini-PC (C:\Users\yoshi) and Tablet-PC (C:\Users\YOSHITO)
- User manages all Git operations; AI should not run git commands
- Obsidian documents use tab indents, always
- User's Q4 focus: Periodic Note habit improvement with varying granularity per topic
